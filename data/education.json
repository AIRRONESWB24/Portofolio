This final-year undergraduate project focuses on the design and implementation of an automated product filling and sealing system using a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). The system integrates sensors and actuators with PLC-based ladder logic to automate the packaging process, ensuring accuracy, efficiency, and consistency while reducing manual labor. The project demonstrates strong technical competency in industrial automation, control systems, and embedded integration, and serves as a prototype for future applications in manufacturing environments. Supervised by Dadi, S.T., M.Eng. and Suryono, S.T., M.Eng., this work reflects practical experience in designing real-world automation systems. Final GPA: 3.01 (scale of 4.00)."
